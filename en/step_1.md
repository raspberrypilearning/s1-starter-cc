### 2. Animation: Skills in careers that involve Computing

Click on the green flag to begin the animation on skills in careers that involve Computing.

You can watch the animation as a group or on your own.

Either read the text or, if you’ve got access to sound, you can also listen to a narration of the text.

Tick off the activity when you have completed it.

### 3. Game: Skills Sorting

--- task ---

Click on the green flag to begin the Skills Sorting game. As with all activities, tick it off when you have completed it.

Don’t forget, you need to work your way through the projects in the order they are listed because that’s the way this module has been designed. You’ll miss some key instructions otherwise :)
